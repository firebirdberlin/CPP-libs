Dear unknown user,

before you can start using these libraries. You will have to install them properly. 
How to to this is explained in the documentation of mylibs. 

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is included into this package. To create it you will need the program 
doxygen from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/. 

If your linux distribution is not too weird then there should be an appropriate package. 
Otherwise you compile doxygen from the sources which is fairly easy.

To finally create the documentation do
 $ doxygen Doxyfile
 $ cd doc 
 $ firefox index.htm
 
Compilation/Installation
------------
You can compile and install the mylibs yourself, if you
 $ export MYLOCAL=$HOME/local_`uname -m`
 $ ./configure --prefix=$MYLOCAL
 $ make install

Please also add
 export PATH=$MYLOCAL/bin/:$PATH
 export CPATH=$MYLOCAL/include/:$CPATH
 export LIBRARY_PATH=$MYLOCAL/lib/:$LIBRARY_PATH
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MYLOCAL/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

 to your ~/.bashrc .


That's all I have to tell you here. 
So have fun, 
Stefan
